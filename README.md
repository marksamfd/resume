A single-page, one-column resume for software developers. It uses the base latex templates and fonts to provide ease of use and installation when trying to update the resume. The different sections are clearly documented and custom commands are used to provide consistent formatting. The three main sections in the resume are education, experience, and projects.

### Motivation

This was created as a fork or an ATS friendly resume. And my oqn resume lives here with rendered pdf and source LATEX

### License

Format is MIT but all the data is owned by Sourabh Bajaj.
